I did it! I made a game in 48 hours! Although there are no sounds. Or graphics. Or enemies. But you can make a little red square jump up and down!

Okay so it's not really a game but I am sooooo pleased that I got anything done. It's the first game I made ever, using a language I barely know in 48 hours. Time was the biggest constraint and I didn't really start until something like 1pm on Saturday. In the end I only spent about 8 or 9 hours out of the 48 available actually working on the game, but life gets in the way. Those few hours were spent rummaging through the HaxeFlixel API and related documentation. One major time sink was getting OGMO tile maps to import successfully. 

Over the next few weeks I want to complete my game and actually make it fun to play. Anyway here it is - ["The Pen Is Mightier"][pm].
