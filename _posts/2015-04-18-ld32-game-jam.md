The [32nd Ludum Dare][ld] game jam has started this weekend and I am taking part!

I have followed the competition for a few years now, but have never felt good enough programming wise to take part - but this time I do and I'm going for it! For those that don't know, the LD game jam is held 3 times a year and features a compo and a jam. A week before it starts, competitors vote on a large list of possible themes, with the winning one revealed at the start of the competition - 9pm American, which works out at 2am here!

The compo is a solo event of 48 hours where you must make everything yourself - the characters must be drawn by you, the music composed by you (random sound generators are allowed like [Bfxr][b]) and  the actual game must be made by you (game engines such as [Unity3D][un] or [GameMaker][gm] are allowed). The jam allows teams to enter and gives them 72 hours to create a game, they can also use existing assets such as music and graphics.

I will be using the [Haxe][hx] programming language and the [HaxeFlixel][hf] framework along with the [FlashDevelop][fd] IDE. For graphics I will be using [PyxelEdit][py] and the [OGMO][o] title editor to create the tile map. Sound will be created with [Bfxr][b] and I will use [Bosca Ceoil][bs] for music.

As this is my first time entering don't expect great things *from me* in just 48 hours, I am new to Haxe as well so I will be learning as I go! Good luck to all those taking part!
